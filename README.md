# 🎛️ Gesture-Based Volume Control using Python

A computer vision-based project that allows you to control your **system volume using hand gestures** — just by using your **webcam**. This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyCaw** to detect the distance between your **thumb and index finger**, and adjusts the system volume accordingly.

## 📌 Features

- 🖐️ Real-time hand tracking
- 🔊 Volume controlled by distance between thumb and index finger
- 🎨 On-screen visuals for feedback (volume bar, % level, finger tips)
- ✅ Close app via ❌ button or press **`q`**
- 🪶 Lightweight and easy to run

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **OpenCV** captures real-time webcam frames.
2. **MediaPipe** detects your hand and landmarks.
3. Distance between **thumb tip (ID 4)** and **index finger tip (ID 8)** is calculated using `math.hypot()`.
4. **NumPy** interpolates this distance into a volume percentage (0–100%).
5. **PyCaw** sets the actual system volume using Windows audio APIs.
6. Visual feedback is displayed in the OpenCV window.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Make sure you are using **Python 3.6 or higher** and are on **Windows OS**.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw comtypes
```
> ✅ **Note**: This project works **only on Windows** due to the use of the `pycaw` library,
> which depends on the Windows Core Audio APIs.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the `gesture_volume_control.py` file.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
python newMain.py
```

3. Show your hand in front of the webcam.

4. Move thumb and index finger:

  👉 Closer: Decrease volume

  👉 Farther: Increase volume

5. Exit by pressing q or clicking the ❌ window close button.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🤖 Add support for multi-gesture recognition (e.g., mute, skip, pause)
- 💻 Cross-platform compatibility (support for macOS and Linux using alternative audio libraries)
- 🎨 Enhanced user interface with animated feedback or sound alerts
- 📷 Add calibration step to improve accuracy across hand sizes and lighting conditions
