# Gesture-Volume-Control
Gesture-Based Volume Control

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for gesture-based volume control using hand tracking and landmark detection. By leveraging libraries like MediaPipe, Pycaw, OpenCV, and NumPy, the system processes real-time webcam input to detect hand gestures and dynamically adjust system volume.

Key Features

Hand Tracking with MediaPipe: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.

Volume Control via Pycaw: Maps the distance between the thumb and index finger to system volume levels, providing a seamless and intuitive control experience.

Real-Time Processing: Employs OpenCV for video feed capture and visualization of hand gestures.

Mathematical Mapping: Uses NumPy for efficient interpolation of hand gesture data into meaningful actions, such as volume adjustments.

This project showcases the practical integration of machine learning models with computer vision and system-level controls for innovative human-computer interaction.
